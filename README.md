# Footy Insights ⚽📊

*A Relational Database System for Football Analytics*

Footy Insights is a structured database project developed using MySQL to store, manage, and query comprehensive football-related data. Designed as part of a DBMS course, this project showcases the application of relational schema design, normalization, and SQL querying to derive meaningful insights from football statistics.

## 📌 Features

* **Normalized Relational Schema**: Efficient design adhering to 3NF for entities such as Players, Teams, Matches, Stadiums, and Managers.
* **Rich Dataset**: Synthetic but realistic data capturing essential football metrics like goals, assists, match results, player positions, nationalities, etc.
* **Complex SQL Queries**: Includes analytical queries to extract insights like top scorers, win ratios, team performance trends, and match histories.
* **ER Diagram**: A well-defined Entity-Relationship diagram to visually represent database structure and relationships.
* **Functional Dependency and Decomposition**: Demonstrates how raw data was refined into normalized tables using dependency analysis.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **MySQL**
* **SQL Workbench / Command Line Tools**
* **DB Designer / Draw\.io** (for ER diagrams)
* **Git / GitHub** for version control

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience in **relational database modeling**, **schema refinement**, and **data normalization**.
* Strengthened proficiency in **SQL DDL/DML**, **JOIN operations**, **nested queries**, and **aggregations**.
* Understood the importance of **data integrity**, **consistency**, and **query optimization**.

## 📁 Contents

* `/ER_Diagram/` – Contains the ER diagram and relational schema
* `/Schema and Queries/` – SQL files to create tables, insert data, and execute queries
* `/Docs/` – Design explanations, assumptions, and functional dependency breakdowns

## 🔍 Sample Queries

* Find the top 5 goal scorers in a specific season
* Retrieve all matches where a player scored and assisted
* List teams with the highest win percentage
* Identify managers with the longest undefeated streaks
